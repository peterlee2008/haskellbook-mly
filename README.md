# haskellbook-mly

This is a repository for collaboratively working through exercises from [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com).

> The book can be purchased through [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/haskellbook)

## What
The idea is to work through all the exercises in the book and learn a some Haskell. Yo, Haskell is no joke so the estimated effort is ~6-10h per week :wink:.

## How
We'll be working through **~2 book chapters per week**. We might adjust this assumption at some point as certain chapters are _denser_ than others.

## Participating
Ping @knikel in the **#fp** Slack channel that you'd like to take part **before 1st of April**.
